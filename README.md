## Launch Codes:
Prerequisites:
    Python 3 is installed and necessary environment variables are setup properly.

Clone repo:
    <br>
    In the directory you want to have the code in, type into a terminal
    <br>
    ```
    $ git clone git@github.com:turtlelazy/cybersecurity_final.git
    ```
    
Create a virtual environment (unless you already have one):
    <br>
    A virtual environment can be created using the following line in a terminal 
    <br>
    ```
    $ python3 -m venv ~/path/to/virtual/environment/directory
    ```
    <br>
    The virtual environment can then be activated by being in the right directory, then typing the following line in a terminal
    <br>
    ```
    $ source (name of virtual environment directory)/bin/activate
    ```
    <br>
    To then install the required packages, navigate to this repository, and enter in the following with the virtual environment activated:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
Launching the website app:
    <br>
    cd into app
    <br>
    activate the virtual environment
    <br>
    run ```python3 __init__.py``` 
    <br>
    Open the link given from the the terminal.
